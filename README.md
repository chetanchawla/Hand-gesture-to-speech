# Hand-gesture-to-speech
Hello i'm working on a project to convert hand gestures to speech. It is mainly focused to help mute people to communicate with people who does'nt know sign languuage.

Items Required:
Arduino Uno
Python IDE(Anaconda, Spyder, Python(x,y))
MPU9150 or MPU 6050(You could use any motion sensor just retrieve the raw accl,gyro,mag value and send to python script)
1-Push Button
Flex Sensors(You can also use velostat for making your own flex sensor.)
Resistors
Arduino USB cable type A/B

Steps:
1. Make connections between Arduino and MPU9150(SDA-A4 , SCL-A5 , Vcc-3.3V , GND-Ground , INT-Digital Pin 2)
2. Install Python and the required libraries.
3. Now burn the Arduino code in Arduino.

  CLOSING BATCH
 Open the Serial monitor and the press the button the output looks like the above format.
 4.Now fpr Python part there are two steps:
 
  
  Training : This Involves teaching the algorithm what kind of data it data it should expect. As of now each gesture is associated with   a character ( case sensitive ). This means that you can teach the algorithm a maximum of about 60 different gestures.
  
  Enter the following command in cmd to execute the python script.(port=your arduino com port, target= (gesture):(batch))
                            python start.py target=a:0 port=COM6
  
  Train the model: trainign the model lets you save gestures and be able to use them later.
                            python learn.py
  
  
  Testing : Command for predictng a gesture and speech output
  
                            python start.py port=<YOUR_SERIAL_PORT> predict
